            Hey there! Thanks for stopping by — this is the first post on my portfolio blog. I’ll be using this space to share updates on what I’m building, the ideas I’m exploring, and lessons I pick up along the way.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into cybersecurity, while also experimenting with some frontend projects using React and Tailwind CSS. I find it really fun to combine a solid technical foundation with clean, thoughtful UI.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ll occasionally write about specific challenges I’ve run into, things I’ve learned from building projects, or just general thoughts around code and technology. This is as much a place for me to track my progress as it is a way to share with others.
        </p>

        <p>
            If anything you see here resonates with you — or if you just want to say hi — feel free to connect. I’m always open to feedback, collaboration, or just good conversation.
        </p>

        <p>More to come soon. Stay tuned!</p>
